when creating a club - create a UserClubs entry (can we do this with a trigger?)

# App

Google SSO
Design page layouts 
Remove epic web files

# Club Page

If only one club assigned to user, on login show that club page

## Members

* list members - these aren't users (but users can be members)
* add member
* delete member 
* set member as admin
* only admins can add/delete members

## Seasons 

* Crud seasons - only admin can modify
* Only one season can be active
  
## Attendance

* Add attendance for a date
* Add members / guests to attendance
* mark if guest paid or not
